## Features




https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64b0b329-86f2-4dfd-afc6-742b0802f051





This addon allows you to customize the footer by adding blocks to it. You can add any type of block to create rich, dynamic footer content. The footer will automatically use the closest footer configuration relative to the current page.

**Key Features:**
- **Block-based customization**: Add any type of Volto block to your footer
- **Context-aware**: Automatically selects the most appropriate footer based on page location
- **Editable behavior**: Only content with the editable footer behavior enabled can be modified
- **Flexible configuration**: The editable footer behavior can be activated on any content type

## Installation

**Requirements:**
- This addon requires [collective.volto.footer](https://github.com/collective/collective.volto.footer) to be installed on the backend.

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 18 and later

Add `volto-footer` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@plone-collective/volto-footer": "*"
}
```

Add `volto-footer` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = [
    ...
    '@kitconcept/volto-light-theme',
    '@plone-collective/volto-footer',
    '<youraddon>',
];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = 'volto-footer';
```

### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon volto-footer
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `volto-footer` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "volto-footer"
],

"dependencies": {
    "volto-footer": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
